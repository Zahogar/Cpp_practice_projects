## Quick description

Asked ChatGPT to give me a list of project in C++ to learn how to code in that language.

## Beginner projects

Here are some beginner-friendly project ideas to help you practice and build your skills in C++:

---

* Number Guessing Game

    Create a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100. The player tries to guess the number, and the program provides feedback ("too high," "too low") after each guess.

    Basic input/output, loops, conditionals, random number generation.

* Simple Calculator

    Implement a calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /). Allow users to input two numbers and the operation.

    Input validation, switch-case statements, and functions.

* To-Do List

    Create a program to manage a simple to-do list. Users can add tasks, view tasks, and mark tasks as completed.

    Arrays or vectors, dynamic memory, file I/O (optional for saving tasks).

* Temperature Converter

    Write a program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

    Functions, input/output handling, and formula implementation.

* Tic-Tac-Toe Game

    Develop a two-player tic-tac-toe game played in the console. 

    2D arrays, game logic, and loops.

* Unit Converter

    Build a unit converter for length (meters to kilometers), weight (grams to kilograms), etc.

    Functions, switch-case statements, and handling user input.

* Basic Bank Management System

    Create a system where users can deposit, withdraw, and check their balance. Use a simple menu system for navigation.

    Classes, encapsulation, and basic object-oriented programming.

* Prime Number Checker

    Write a program that checks if a number is prime. Extend it to print all prime numbers up to a certain number.

    Loops, conditionals, and efficient algorithms.

* Text-Based RPG Game

    Create a simple role-playing game where a player fights monsters, earns points, and levels up.

    Classes, loops, conditionals, and random number generation.

* Student Grading System

    Create a program to input students' names and grades, calculate their average, and determine their letter grades.

    Structures, arrays, and input validation.

* BMI Calculator

    Write a program that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) given a user's height and weight.

    Basic input/output, conditionals, and mathematical calculations.

* File Reader/Writer

    Build a program that reads a file, counts the number of words, and writes the result to another file.

    File handling, strings, and error checking.

* Hangman Game

    Implement a text-based hangman game. Choose random words and allow the user to guess letters.

    Strings, conditionals, and loops.


* Sorting Algorithms Visualizer
    
    Create a program that sorts an array using bubble sort, selection sort, or insertion sort, and prints the array after each step.
    
    Algorithms, loops, and arrays.

* Expense Tracker
    
    Build a program to track your daily expenses. Users can add expenses, categorize them, and view summaries.
    
    Data structures (arrays/vectors), file I/O (for saving data), and user interface design.


## Intermediate projects

* Library Management System

    Add/edit/delete books, search by title/author, manage borrower info.

    Use classes and file I/O for persistent storage.

* Personal Budget Tracker

    Track expenses and income, generate reports.

    Add CSV export/import using file streams.

* Command-Line Text Editor

    Basic features like opening files, editing lines, saving.

    Practice with character-by-character input and file handling.

* Student Database with Sorting & Searching

    Store students with grades, sort by name, GPA, etc.

    Use STL containers like vector, map, and algorithms.

* Mini Shell

    Implement a basic shell that runs user commands using system() or exec equivalents.

    Learn about fork(), pipe(), and process handling on Linux.

* Simple Chat App (Local)

    Build a text-based chat app using sockets (TCP/UDP).

    Great for learning client-server architecture.


## Advanced projects

* Othello/Reversi Game with AI

    Implement full game logic with a simple AI using minimax or alpha-beta pruning.

    Use SFML or Qt for a GUI version.

* Task Scheduler (like cron)

    Allow users to schedule tasks to run at certain times.

    Multithreading, time parsing, and system-level calls involved.

* Custom File Compression Tool

    Implement your own version of Huffman coding or Run-Length Encoding.

    Dive into data encoding and binary file operations.

* Multithreaded Web Crawler

    Crawl web pages starting from a URL, fetch titles/content.

    Learn about multithreading, networking, and parsing HTML.

* 2D Physics Engine

    Handle object collision, gravity, and motion.

    Great if you're into game dev or simulations.

* In-Memory Key-Value Store

    Like a tiny version of Redis.

    Practice hash tables, memory management, and command parsing.

* Simple Compiler/Interpreter

    Build a small language with a lexer, parser, and interpreter.

    Learn how programming languages are built.

## Tooling & Ecosystem Projects

* Build Your Own Make-like Tool

    Parse a .build file and compile based on file dependencies.

    Learn file timestamps and dependency resolution.

* Dynamic Plugin Loader

    Load .dll or .so files at runtime and call exported functions.

    Useful for modular applications and engines.
